Bit-Vectors:
    - use number x as a bit vector of n bits:
        (_ bvx n)           does not work for negative numbers
            or
        ((_ to_bv n) x)     works also with negative numbers

    - declaration: (x as a bitvector of n bits)
        (declare-const x (_ BitVec n))
    - for the following operations, var1 and var2 are expressed as above:
        ADDITION: bvadd var1 var2
        SUBSTRACTION: bvsub var1 var2
        MULTIPLICATION: bvmul var1 var2
        DIVISION: bvudiv var1 var2   (put bvsdiv for signed)
        REMAINDER: bvurem var1 var2  (put bvsrem for signed)
        BITWISE OR: bvor var1 var2
        BITWISE AND: bvand var1 var2
        BITWISE XOR: bvxor var1 var2
